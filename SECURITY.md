## ðŸš¨ Educational Purpose and Intentional Vulnerabilities

Please note that this repository is part of an educational workshop on secure software pipelines. It contains **intentional vulnerabilities** for learning and demonstration purposes.

We encourage you to explore and exploit these known issues as part of the workshop exercises. Please **do not** report these intentional vulnerabilities as security issues.

## Reporting Unintentional Vulnerabilities

While this repository contains planned vulnerabilities, it's possible that we've overlooked something. If you believe you have discovered an *unintentional* security vulnerability, we would appreciate your help in disclosing it to us privately.

Please report any suspected unintentional vulnerabilities by emailing us at **[security@unicrons.cloud]**.

We are committed to addressing security issues responsibly and will make every effort to respond to your report as quickly as possible. We kindly ask that you do not disclose the issue publicly until we have had a chance to review and address it.
